Usages:
> Please set up the image path and make sure it is correct and then run it in the main.m file. main file is used to execute the whole program, embedding file is the embedding program for the image bitstream, recovery file is used for image recovery, candidate file is used to find the candidate peak pairs, and testprocess is used for the test program for the peak pairs. The user can make more modifications and optimizations on these files and use them in the program.
